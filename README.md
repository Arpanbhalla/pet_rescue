# Pet Rescue

This is an individual project made as a part of General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Course. Being a dog lover, I tried to create a platform for people to buy/sell pets online. The exciting parts of this project are Google Maps Integration and Online Comments. This project was made within a week.



### Background

Requirements for the project
* Have at least 3 models (more if they make sense)
  * one representing someone using your application
  * one that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with encrypted passwords & an authorisation flow.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
* Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data.

### Result

The project uses three models:

* Users - Which inclues the buyer and the seller

* Comments - Comments on the Animal posted

* Animals - To be sold, uploaded by the user.

Github was used for version control. I am proud to deliver this within a week.
